# fastnoise2-sys

`fastnoise2-sys` provides unsafe Rust bindings for [FastNoise2](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2), a C++ library for modular node graph-based noise generation with SIMD.

These bindings are automatically generated using [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen).

For a higher-level, mostly safe API, consider using [fastnoise2](https://crates.io/crates/fastnoise2)
