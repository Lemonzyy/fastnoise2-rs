# fastnoise2

`fastnoise2` provides an easy-to-use and mostly safe interface for the [FastNoise2](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise2) C++ library, which provides modular node graph-based noise generation using SIMD.

This crate acts as a wrapper around [fastnoise2-sys](https://crates.io/crates/fastnoise2-sys), the unsafe bindings for FastNoise2.
